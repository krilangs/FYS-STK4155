In the figures folder, we have all the figures that we made when we analyzed the Franke function. This includes:\
  -The best fit 3D plots of the three regression models.\
  -3D plots plots of the Franke function, with and without noise (two types of noises).\
  -R2-score heatmaps for Ridge and Lasso, with and without noise.\
  -Bias plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with varying model complexity.\
  -Variance plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with varying model complexity.\
  -Plots of the bias-variance tradeoff for test and training data with varying model complexity for OLS, Ridge and Lasso.\
  -Plots of the confidence intervals for OLS, Ridge and Lasso.\

In the terrain_figures folder, we have all the figures we made when we analyzed the digital terrain data of Hardangervidda in Norway. This includes:\
