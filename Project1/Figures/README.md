In the figures folder, we have all the figures that we made when we analyzed the Franke function. This includes:\
 - The best fit 3D plots of the three regression models.\
 - 3D plots plots of the Franke function, with and without noise (two types of noises).\
 - R2-score heatmaps for Ridge and Lasso, with and without noise.\
 - Bias plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with varying model complexity.\
 - Variance plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with varying model complexity.\
 - Plots of the bias-variance tradeoff for test and training data with varying model complexity for OLS, Ridge and Lasso.\
 - Plots of the confidence intervals for OLS, Ridge and Lasso.\

In the terrain_figures folder, we have all the figures we made when we analyzed the digital terrain data of Hardangervidda in Norway. This includes:\
- A 2D and 3D plots of the digital terrain data before analysis.\
- 3D plots of the best fit OLS, Ridge and Lasso.\
- R2-score heatmaps for Ridge and Lasso.\
- Bias plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with different model complexities.\
- Variance plots from the bias-variance tradeoff for OLS, Ridge and Lasso, with different model complexities.\
- Plots of the bias-variance tradeoff with different model complexities for OLS, Ridge and Lasso.
