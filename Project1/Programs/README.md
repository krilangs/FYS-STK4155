funcs.py:
- Here we have all our functions and regression models which we use in the analysis of the data sets.

main.py:
- This is the main program that we use to do all the analysis on the Franke function.

plots.py:
- This program contains all the plotting we do in this project.

terrain.py:
- Here we do all the analysis of the digital terrain data.

test_func.py:
- Here we test the implementation of the OLS function, Ridge function and k-fold function, from main.py, with built in functions in Python from Scikit-learn for these functions.

NB! Be aware that if wanting to run some of the tasks in the codes, then you should comment ut the wanted task and run that one alone. For some reason we get different results when running som tasks alone then when running several task at once.

n59_e010_1arc_v3.tif is the digital terrain data file that we downloaded for an area of Hardangervidda in Norway.
