Here we have all the text files we made when analyzing the data sets. 
They contain values for the model complexity, hyperparameters, MSE, R2-score, variances and biases fro different runds of OLS, Ridge and Lasso. 
The text files may be a bit confusing, but they are mostly meant as easy implementation into the LaTeX report file.
